# Pitch

Welcome to the MOS 6502 Logisim Evolution Emulator project! This repository contains a fully-functional (To The Best of my Knowledge) emulator for the classic 6502 microprocessor, built as part of an undergraduate computer science course. My goal was to understand the inner workings of one of the most influential CPUs in computing history by recreating it in software. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or seasoned developer, you'll find value in exploring this emulator.

# To Run
1) either download logisim evolution from: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution or run Logisim_Evolution.jar
2) open 6502_Emulation.circ
3) select the RAM comonent then in the properties window at the bottom left select contents: (click to edit)
4) In the Hex Editor window select the open button in the bottom left, then select any program you whish to run an example Bubble Sort is provided.
5) In the Main window select simulate in the top left enable ticks or press control T to manual cause a clock tick.

# Design 

This project is comprised of a number of components which can be veiwed as sub-circuits within the 6502_Emulation.circ file or accessed individually as .circ files within the components folder of this repository.
