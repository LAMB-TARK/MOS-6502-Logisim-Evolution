# Pitch

Welcome to the MOS 6502 Logisim Evolution Emulator project! This repository contains a fully-functional (To The Best of my Knowledge) emulator for the classic 6502 microprocessor, built as part of an undergraduate computer science course. My goal was to understand the inner workings of one of the most influential CPUs in computing history by recreating it in software. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or seasoned developer, you'll find value in exploring this emulator.

# To Run
1) either download logisim evolution from: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution or run Logisim_Evolution.jar
2) within Logisim open 6502_Emulation.circ
3) select the RAM comonent then in the properties window at the bottom left select contents: (click to edit)
4) In the Hex Editor window select the open button in the bottom left, then select any program you whish to run an example Bubble Sort is provided.
5) In the Main window select simulate in the top left enable ticks or press CTRL T to manual cause a clock tick.

# Design 

This project consists of multiple components, which can be viewed as sub-circuits within the 6502_Emulation.circ file or accessed individually as .circ files in the components folder of this repository. If you're interested in the design details of these components, I recommend reading Implementation Chapter. 10. of the Emulating_6502.pdf document, submitted as part of my final year dissertation project.

# Learning 6502

If you're interested in learning to write 6502 machine code, I recommend starting with the Requirements and Analysis chapter for an understanding of how 6502 instructions are processed. Next, visit http://www.6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/instructions.html for overview of all possible 6502 instructions. Finally, for example programs written in 6502 assembly, check out the tutorials at 6502.org.

# Project Status and Contributions

This project is still being actively tested and developed however no other major features are expected to be added. Due to this I encourage and would appricate any feedback via Github. If you want to contact me futher please use the following email 25717330@students.lincoln.ac.uk

# Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without help and feedback from Prof. Charles Fox and Kristraps Jurkans.
